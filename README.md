# CodiakPhraseToEntropy (Private Research Build)

🔒 **Private Repository** — developed and maintained by **Ainsley Leopold-James**

This project is a symbolic entropy modulation tool built on **Codiak Core 0.3**, integrating interactive sliders, phrase-to-symbolic transformations, and export capabilities for mathematical introspection and creative simulations.

## 🔬 Features

- ⚛️ **Codiak Core 0.3 Entropy Engine**
- 🌀 Symbolic modelling of phrase influence on entropy density
- 🎚️ Interactive **slider** to modulate `sin(xy + t)` injection
- 📦 **Export to CSV** for logging entropy signatures
- 🎙️ Voice input placeholder for symbolic phrase injection
- 🔁 Compatible with **Binder**, **SageMath**, and **Juno Pro on iPad**
